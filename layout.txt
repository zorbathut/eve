[SIZE="4"]Standard orders[/size]

[indent]To make an order, just post here with what you want, whether you want it in KZF, 77s, FAT, or QY6, and who you want it contracted to. I guarantee normal orders will be sent within 24 hours. If not, you'll get a 10% discount, and feel free to cancel your normal order at any time for any reason.

If you don't tell me where you want it I'll put it wherever I feel like, and if you don't tell me who it should be contracted to I'll send it to your username or the first character listed that you own. If this wasn't what you wanted, it doesn't count towards the 24-hour limit :v:

If you want a little extra adventure in your life, PM me with your order! I might see it or I might not. Who knows? It's a gamble! You can achieve a similar thing by sending me an eve-mail. Guarantees are waived if you do either of those.

All contracts are set for 14 days, since I've never come even near running out of slots.

If you just want one of the above items, you can probably stop reading now.[/indent]



[SIZE="4"]Hardwirings galore![/size]

[indent]I'm currently not keeping hardwirings in stock, so any hardwiring will take a bit to bring down. This may change once I figure out what the most popular ones are. Prices listed here are [i]not[/i] final - hardwiring prices tend to be volatile. If the price jumps enough that I'd be losing money I'll let you know and give you a new price, otherwise I'll just sell you one at the original price (and change the listed price.) If you think something I have here is way too expensive, let me know - sometimes prices drop too.

I'm not listing all hardwirings here, only the ones that seemed most useful to me when skimming. There's a lot of weird specialty stuff that I am not including (3% target painter capacitor need reduction, for example :v:). Every 3% implant here comes in a 5% flavor also, which generally costs around 180m (ask for quote) and requires Cybernetics ~2 levels higher. 6% implants have a similar improved 10% version, 2% implants have a 4% version.

[b]If you think a price is significantly too high, tell me.[/b] These prices change constantly and I don't update the entire list every week, so I might very well say "oh hay actually that's half the price now, thanks for telling me".

[b]Weird Shit[/b]
There are some implants which are different from standard hardwirings. They often provide better bonuses in weird slot locations, don't show up on the market, are horrifically expensive and hard to find, and have confusing skill requirements. I'll list these here for completion's sake since you might not find out about them otherwise.
  
[indent]Slot 7: Michi's Excavation Augmentor - 5% mining laser yield bonus - ~550m, Cybernetics V
Slot 7: Ogdin's Eye Coordination Enhancer - 6% turret tracking speed bonus - ~300m, Cybernetics III
Slot 7: Shaqil's Speed Enhancer - 8% velocity bonus - ~900m, Cybernetics IV
Slot 7: Zor's Custom Navigation Link - 10% afterburner duration bonus - ~20m, Cybernetics V
Slot 8: Zor's Custom Navigation Hyper-Link - 5% afterburner/MWD speed boost bonus - See above, Cybernetics IV
Slot 9: Pashan's Turret Customization Mindlink - 7% turret rate of fire bonus - ~1.1b, Cybernetics IV
Slot 10: Pashan's Turret Handling Mindlink - 7% large energy turret damage bonus - ~600m
Slot 10: Whelan Machorin's Ballistic Smartlink - 5% missile launcher ROF bonus - ~300m
Slot 10: Akemon's Modified 'Noble' ZET5000 - 8% armor HP bonus - ~750m[/indent]


Some implants that EFT lists simply don't seem to exist, sometimes in the market, sometimes in both market and contract. If it's a normal hardwiring and isn't in the market, I've never seen any in-stock in contracts. I haven't seen any capship-related implants, for example, and EFT lists quite a lot of those. I suspect they currently can't be acquired. There's also several weird named hardwirings that EFT lists that don't show up in contracts. I probably can't get those for you either, sorry.[/indent]

[SIZE="4"]Special orders[/size]

[indent]I'll cheerfully hop weird implants, skillbooks, blueprints, or any other small things down. My prices tend to be 20-30% higher than Jita prices, though I'll try to save you money when possible. Skillbooks probably aren't worth it unless you want them in bulk for some reason or don't have a jump clone (in which case, get a damn jump clone, it's not that hard.) Please ask for a price check before buying - if for some reason I can't honor a price check after I've given it, I'll let you know, but this should be incredibly rare. I'd much rather do a price check than have to resell something I bought intending to import.

If you just say "I want a (expensive implant)" I'll assume that you're fine with my normal markup and bring one down. If you cancel after I've already bought the item I'll be annoyed at you :argh:[/indent]
